### 1. Purpose of This Document
This document formally defines the TeamStation AI domain and subdomain architecture, including canonical URLs, functional purpose of each subdomain, strategic rationale, and why this architecture is critical to scalability, security, SEO authority, and product clarity.

This structure is intentional. It is not accidental, cosmetic, or legacy driven.

### 2. Primary Domain
`https://teamstation.dev`

Role: Corporate root and brand authority anchor.

Purpose:
The root domain represents the company as a single legal, commercial, and reputational entity. It establishes brand trust, organizational identity, and acts as the semantic parent for all specialized subdomains.

Why this matters:
Search engines, partners, and enterprises treat the root domain as the source of truth. All downstream authority flows from here.

### 3. Subdomain Architecture
Each subdomain is a deliberate cognitive and functional boundary. This avoids audience dilution, improves crawl efficiency, and enables independent scaling.

- `https://www.teamstation.dev` Public website alias.
- `https://app.teamstation.dev` Core application platform with security/performance isolation.
- `https://hire.teamstation.dev` Hiring and nearshore services content.
- `https://cto.teamstation.dev` CTO strategy and technical leadership content.
- `https://cio.teamstation.dev` CIO governance and enterprise scale content.
- `https://docs.teamstation.dev` Documentation hub.
- `https://engineering.teamstation.dev` Engineering knowledge and systems content.
- `https://research.teamstation.dev` Research and scientific publications.
- `https://articles.teamstation.dev` Long-form editorial content.
- `https://insights.teamstation.dev` Insights and analysis layer.
- `https://partner.teamstation.dev` Partner-focused content.
- `https://jobs.teamstation.dev` Job listings and candidate entry point.
- `https://benchmarks.teamstation.dev` Benchmark evidence and comparative performance intelligence.

### 4. Strategic Rationale
This architecture enables:
- Audience separation without brand fragmentation
- Independent SEO authority per intent cluster
- Security isolation between app, content, and hiring
- Scalable publishing velocity without cross contamination
- Clear mental models for users and search engines

Each subdomain behaves as a specialized node within a unified system.

### 5. Why This Is Critical
Without this structure:
- SEO authority collapses into noise
- Buyer intent becomes ambiguous
- Security boundaries blur
- Analytics lose meaning
- Content competes with itself

With this structure:
- Each domain compounds authority
- Google understands topical ownership
- Executives feel spoken to, not marketed at
- Engineers trust the system
- The platform scales without entropy

This is not a website layout. It is an operating model for knowledge, trust, and execution.

### 6. Governance
All new content, systems, or initiatives must map to an existing subdomain or justify the creation of a new one with:
- Clear audience definition
- Distinct intent
- Non-overlapping semantics

No exceptions.
