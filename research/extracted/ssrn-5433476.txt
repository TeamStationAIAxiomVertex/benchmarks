designed
 
to
 
empower
 
businesses
 
with
 
unparalleled
 
access
 
to
 
top-tier
 
IT
 
talent
 
and
 
advanced
 
AI-driven
 
operational
 
capabilities.
 
Our
 
mission
 
is
 
to
 
redefine
 
how
 
companies
 
engage
 
with
 
and
 
leverage
 
global
 
IT
 
expertise,
 
ensuring
 
seamless
 
integration,
 
predictive
 
success,
 
and
 
cultural
 
alignment.
 
What  TeamStation  AI  Does:  Our  platform  is  a  holistic  solution  that  addresses  the  entire  lifecycle  of  nearshore  IT  engagement,  from  
talent
 
discovery
 
to
 
project
 
delivery.
 
It

clients
 
with:
 ●  Vast  Talent  Network  Access:  Direct  access  to  a  meticulously  curated  database  of  over  2.6  million  
LATAM
 
IT
 
professionals.
 
This
 
network
 
is
 
continuously
 
updated
 
and
 
profiled,
 
offering
 
a
 
deep
 
bench
 
of
 
specialized
 
skills.
 ●  Intelligent  Talent  Matching  &  Evaluation:  This  is  where  Axiom  Cortex  plays  a  pivotal  role.  Our  
AI-driven
 
engine
 
goes
 
beyond
 
traditional
 
resume
 
screening
 
to
 
perform
 
deep
 
neuro-psychometric
 
and
 
NLP-based
 
evaluations,
 
ensuring
 
candidates
 
possess
 
not
 
only
 
the
 
required
 
technical
 
skills
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
optimal
 
cognitive
 
and
 
cultural
 
fit.
 ●  AI-Powered  Operations  Management:  The  platform  intelligently  manages  IT  operations,  including  
resource
 
allocation,
 
project

build
 
solutions
 
across
 
the
 
entire
 
Software
 
Development
 
Lifecycle
 
(SDLC),
 
ensuring
 
high-quality
 
deliverables
 
and
 
seamless
 
cultural
 
alignment
 
with
 
US
 
business
 
practices.
 The  Problem  We  Solve:  The  traditional  approach  to  sourcing  and  evaluating  IT  talent,  especially  in  nearshore  markets,  is  often  
subjective,
 
prone
 
to
 
biases
 
(particularly
 
against
 
L2
 
ESL
 
speakers),
 
and
 
fails
 
to
 
accurately
 
measure
 
the
 
deep
 
technical
 
skills
 
and
 
cognitive
 
abilities
 
required
 
for
 
complex
 
software
 
development.
 
This
 
leads
 
to
 
inefficient
 
hiring,
 
mis-hires,
 
and
 
a
 
failure
 
to
 
tap
 
into
 
the
 
full
 
potential
 
of
 
diverse
 
global
 
talent
 
pools.
 
TeamStation
 
AI's
 
integrated
 
platform,
 
with
 
Axiom
 
Cortex
 
at
 
its
 
core,
 
directly
 
tackles
 
these
 
inefficiencies
 
and
 
biases.
 
Our  Solution:  The  Axiom  Cortex  Feature  within  the  TeamStation  AI  Ecosystem  Axiom  Cortex  is  not  a  standalone  tool;  it's  a  critical,  integrated  component  of  the  TeamStation  AI  platform.

provides
 
the
 
scientifically
 
rigorous,
 
bias-mitigated
 
evaluation
 
necessary
 
to
 
leverage
 
our
 
vast
 
talent
 
network
 
effectively.
 
By
 
understanding
 
the
 
true
 
cognitive
 
and
 
technical
 
capabilities
 
of
 
each
 
candidate,
 
we
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
talent

to
 
our
 
clients
 
is
 
not
 
only
 
skilled
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
right
 
cognitive
 
and
 
cultural
 
fit.

2.1.  Key  Scientific  Pillars:  Neuro-Psychometric  Profiling  via  Latent  Trait  Inference  Engine  (LTIE):  The  Axiom  Cortex  infers  critical  candidate  traits,  which  we  then  quantify  and  benchmark:  ●  Architectural  Instinct  (AI):  Assesses  a  candidate's  ability  to  think  top-down,  design  robust  systems,  
and
 
manage
 
high-level
 
trade-offs.
 ●  Problem-Solving  Agility  (PSA):  Evaluates  how  effectively  a  candidate  deconstructs  problems,  
adapts
 
to
 
new
 
constraints,
 
and
 
explores
 
multiple
 
solution
 
paths.
 ●  Learning  Orientation  (LO):  Measures  intellectual  honesty,  coachability,  and  a  genuine  drive  to  
learn
 
–
 
our
 
proxy
 
for
 
a
 
growth
 
mindset.
 ●  Collaborative  Mindset  (CM):  Assesses  a  candidate's  tendency  to  work  in  a  team  context,  consider  
stakeholder
 
impact,
 
and
 
foster
 
shared
 
understanding.
 These  traits  are  scored  on  a  5-point  scale,  visualized  in  detailed  cognitive  fingerprints,  and  derived  from  a  
synthesis
 
of
 
per-question
 
B-Axiom
 
scores,
 
forensic
 
linguistic
 
features,
 
and
 
observed
 
behavioral
 
evidence.
 
 Advanced  NLP  Integration  (The  Science  of  Language  Analysis):  We  employ  a  comprehensive  suite  of  Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  techniques,  meticulously  
integrated
 
into
 
our
 
prompt
 
engineering:
 ●  Phonology  &  Morphology:  Analyzing  language  for  patterns  indicative  of  L1  influence  on  word  
formation
 
and
 
pronunciation.
 
This
 
helps
 
us
 
understand
 
potential
 
cognitive
 
load
 
and
 
semantic
 
nuances
 
without
 
penalizing
 
for
 
non-native
 
fluency.
 ●  Syntactic  Analysis  (Chunking,  Parsing,  Grammatical  Formalisms):  Evaluating  sentence  structure,  
idea
 
grouping
 
(chunking),
 
and
 
grammatical
 
frameworks
 
to
 
understand
 
thought
 
organization
 
and
 
clarity.
 
This
 
directly
 
informs
 
our
 
B_C
 
(Clarity)
 
and
 
B_L
 
(Cognitive
 
Load)
 
scores.
 ●  Semantic  Processing  &  Lexical  Semantics:  Critically  assessing  the  candidate's  understanding  of  
meaning,
 
core
 
concepts,
 
their
 
relationships
 
(ontology),
 
and
 
the
 
precision
 
of
 
their
 
word
 
choices.
 
We
 
prioritize
 
accurate
 
conveyance
 
of
 
meaning
 
over
 
exact
 
terminology,
 
recognizing
 
valid
 
paraphrasing
 
and
 
conceptual
 
entailment
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
Conceptual
 
Fidelity
 
Protocol.
 ●  Discourse  Analysis:  Examining  the  overall  coherence,  cohesion,  logical  flow,  and  argument  structure  
of
 
the
 
candidate's
 
response
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
they
 
present
 
complete
 
thoughts.
 ●  Linguistic  Resources  &  Statistical/Knowledge-Based  Methods:  Leveraging  internal  linguistic  
knowledge
 
and
 
statistical
 
methods
 
to
 
identify
 
patterns,
 
L1
 
interference,
 
and
 
unique
 
cognitive
 
styles.
 ●  Paraphrasing,  Entailment,  and  Generation:  Actively  identifying  instances  where  candidates  correctly  
express
 
concepts
 
using
 
different
 
phrasing
 
or
 
imply
 
understanding,
 
adhering
 
to
 
the
 
Conceptual
 
Fidelity
 
Protocol.
 Bias  Mitigation  (The  Cortex  Calibration  Layer):  This  is  a  non-negotiable,  system-critical  directive.  Our  Cortex  Calibration  Layer  acts  as  a  sophisticated  
filter,
 
applying
 
algorithmic
 
adjustments
 
to
 
raw
 
scores
 
based
 
on
 
detected
 
L1
 
interference
 
patterns
 
and
 
cultural
 
communication
 
styles.
 
This
 
ensures
 
we
 
evaluate
 
the
 
pure
 
technical
 
and
 
logical
 
signal,
 
not
 
linguistic
 
"noise."
 
Specific
 
calibrations
 
are
 
applied
 
to:
 ●  B_A  (Accuracy)  -  "Politeness  Filter":  Adjusts  hedging  based  on  cultural  norms.  ●  B_P  (Procedural  Knowledge)  -  "Collectivist  Filter":  Modifies  the  impact  of  ownershipRatio  to  account  
for
 
collectivist
 
communication
 
styles.

=== PAGE 5 ===

●  B_L  (Cognitive  Load)  -  "Translation  Filter"  &  "Working  Memory  Uplift":  Adjusts  B_L  based  on  L2  
processing
 
strain
 
and
 
applies
 
uplifts
 
for
 
flags
 
like
 
coherence_with_reduced_detail_L2_flag.
 ●  B_C  &  CTA_CE  -  "Cultural  Pragmatic  Re-interpretation":  Adjusts  scoring  to  value  culturally  nuanced  
communication
 
styles,
 
moving
 
beyond
 
Western-centric
 
directness.
 ●  B_A  &  B_M  -  "Spontaneous  Speech  Credibility":  Applies  penalties  for  unnatural_text_fluency_flag  to  
differentiate
 
genuine
 
understanding
 
from
 
rote
 
memorization.
 Behavioral  Answer  Deconstruction:  For  behavioral  questions,  answers  are  deconstructed  into  core  conceptual  components  (Problem  
Identification,
 
Impact
 
Analysis,
 
Action
 
&
 
Agency,
 
Justification
 
&
 
Influence)
 
rather
 
than
 
judged
 
against
 
rigid
 
frameworks
 
like
 
STAR,
 
respecting
 
cross-cultural
 
communication
 
theory
 
and
 
avoiding
 
bias.
 
Scientific  Grounding:  All  analyses  are  strictly  traceable  to  provided  input  data  and  foundational  documents,  ensuring  zero  
hallucination
 
and
 
absolute
 
adherence
 
to
 
specified
 
algorithms
 
and
 
data.
 
The
 
"No
 
Evidence"
 
clause
 
mandates
 
explicit
 
statements
 
when
 
evidence
 
is
 
insufficient.
 
3.  The  Axiom  Cortex  Methodology:  Self-Governing,  Phasic  Micro-Chunking  NLP  Prompt  
Engineering
 The  operational  backbone  of  Axiom  Cortex  is  its  novel  approach  to  executing  complex  NLP  tasks:  a  
Self-Governing,
 
Self-Learning
 
Phasic
 
Micro-Chunking
 
NLP-based
 
Prompt
 
Engineering
 
technique.
 
This
 
methodology
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
maximum
 
accuracy,
 
token
 
efficiency,
 
and
 
minimal
 
external
 
dependencies,
 
allowing
 
the
 
LLM
 
itself
 
to
 
perform
 
the
 
core
 
analytical
 
heavy
 
lifting.
 
3.1.  Phasic  Micro-Chunking  Execution  Protocol:  The  UCE  operates  through  a  strictly  sequential,  multi-phase  workflow,  ensuring  each  step  is  completed  
and
 
validated
 
before
 
proceeding:
 ●  Phase  0:  Pre-Execution  Integrity  Validation:  This  foundational  phase  ensures  the  prompt  and  all  
documents
 
are
 
understood,
 
parameters
 
are
 
confirmed,
 
and
 
the
 
persona/output
 
format
 
is
 
locked.
 
An
 
enhancement
 
mandates
 
the
 
LLM
 
to
 
articulate
 
its
 
understanding
 
of
 
potential
 
linguistic
 
complexity
 
and
 
cognitive
 
diversity,
 
setting
 
the
 
stage
 
for
 
fair
 
analysis.
 ●  Phase  1:  Data  Ingestion  &  Validation:  All  necessary  input  data  (Job  Description,  Must-Haves,  
Questions,
 
Transcript)
 
and
 
foundational
 
documents
 
are
 
loaded
 
and
 
verified.
 ●  Phase  2:  Per-Question  Micro-Analysis  (The  "Micro-Chunking"  Core):  ○  Iterative  Processing:  Each  question-answer  pair  is  treated  as  an  independent  "micro-chunk."  ○  Detailed  Analysis:  For  each  chunk,  the  LLM  performs:  Ideal  Answer  Blueprint  Generation:  
Defining
 
first
 
principles,
 
key

    3.2.  Self-Governing  &  Self-Learning  Aspects:  Self-Governing:  The  phased  protocol  and  embedded  ICAL  checkpoints  create  a  self-governing  system.  
The
 
LLM
 
is
 
instructed
 
to
 
halt
 
or
 
re-process
 
if

on
 
the
 
provided
 
foundational
 
documents
 
and
 
input
 
data
 
demonstrates
 
a
 
form
 
of
 
"learning"
 
within
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
prompt.
 
The
 
system
 
learns
 
to
 
apply
 
the
 
complex
 
ruleset
 
to
 
new
 
data,
 
adapting
 
its
 
output
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
detailed
 
instructions.
 
3.3.  Token  Efficiency  and  Reduced  Backend  Dependency:  Token  Efficiency:  The  micro-chunking  approach  inherently  promotes  token  efficiency  by  allowing  
focused
 
processing
 
of
 
smaller
 
data
 
segments.
 
The
 
prompt's
 
emphasis
 
on
 
conceptual
 
understanding
 
over
 
verbose
 
keyword
 
matching
 
further
 
encourages
 
information-dense
 
LLM
 
outputs,
 
maximizing
 
token
 
utility.
 
No  Backend  Application  Services  for  Core  Analysis:  The  core  NLP  analysis,  scoring,  and  synthesis  
are
 
performed
 
directly
 
by
 
the
 
LLM
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
prompt's
 
instructions
 
and
 
the
 
provided
 
data.
 
This
 
eliminates
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
separate,
 
complex
 
backend
 
NLP
 
services
 
for
 
each
 
analytical
 
step,
 
reducing
 
architectural
 
complexity,
 
latency,
 
and
 
operational
 
overhead.
 
The
 
LLM
 
acts
 
as
 
the
 
integrated
 
NLP
 
engine.

L1-specific  overheads  and  calibration,  crucial  for  understanding  communication  patterns.  ●  Axiom  Scoring  Logic:  Precise  formulas  and  rules  for  calculating  B_P,  B_M,  B_A,  B_C,  B_L,  
incorporating
 
calibration
 
multipliers
 
and
 
buffer
 
thresholds
 
derived
 
from
 
extensive
 
linguistic
 
research.
 ●  Latent  Trait  Calculation  Logic:  Weighted  formulas  for  AI,  PSA,  LO,  CM,  derived  from  specific  
linguistic
 
and
 
behavioral
 
metrics
 
(e.g.,
 
LKD
 
scores,
 
PSTA
 
analysis,
 
authenticityIncidents,
 
ownershipRatio),
 
reflecting
 
psychometric
 
principles.
 ●  Cortex  Calibration  Layer  Parameters:  Specific  values  for  Hedge_Buffer_Threshold,  
Hedge_Penalty_Multiplier,
 
Softening_Factor,
 
etc.,
 
are
 
critical
 
for
 
accurate,
 
bias-mitigated
 
scoring,
 
calibrated
 
through
 
expert
 
linguistic
 
analysis.
 ●  Flag  Detection  Logic:  Boolean  flags  like  coherence_with_reduced_detail_L2_flag,  
stress_marker_detection_L2_flag,
 
and
 
unnatural_text_fluency_flag
 
are
 
triggered
 
based
 
on
 
specific
 
linguistic
 
marker
 
combinations
 
and
 
thresholds,
 
directly
 
impacting
 
axiom
 
scores
 
and
 
informing
 
the
 
Cortex
 
Calibration
 
Layer.
 ●  "Anti-STAR"  Mandate:  For  behavioral  questions,  answers  are  deconstructed  into  core  conceptual  
components
 
(Problem
 
Identification,
 
Impact
 
Analysis,
 
Action
 
&
 
Agency,
 
Justification
 
&
 
Influence)
 
rather
 
than
 
judged
 
against
 
rigid
 
frameworks
 
like
 
STAR,
 
respecting
 
cross-cultural
 
communication
 
theory
 
and
 
avoiding
 
bias.
 ●  "No  Evidence"  Clause:  Strict  adherence  to  stating  "No  direct  evidence  found"  or  "Insufficient  
evidence
 
to
 
evaluate"
 
when
 
a
 
skill
 
is
 
not
 
demonstrated,
 
preventing
 
assumptions
 
and
 
maintaining
 
scientific
 
integrity.
 ●  Conceptual  Fidelity:  The  constant  internal  check:  "Did  the  candidate's  thinking  successfully  converge  
on
 
a
 
conceptually
 
sound
 
solution
 
that
 
addresses
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
problem,
 
even
 
if
 
they
 
used
 
different
 
words
 
or
 
examples?"
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
bedrock
 
of
 
our
 
evaluation,
 
ensuring
 
we
 
measure
 
true
 
understanding.

5.  Frequently  Asked  Questions  (FAQs)  Q1:  What  makes  TeamStation  AI  and  the  Axiom  Cortex  different  from  other  talent  assessment  
tools?
 A1:  TeamStation  AI  offers  an  end-to-end  intelligent  platform  for  nearshore  IT  operations,  leveraging  a  vast  
talent
 
network
 
and
 
AI-driven
 
management.
 
Axiom
 
Cortex,
 
as
 
a
 
core
 
component,
 
differentiates
 
itself
 
through
 
its
 
deep
 
neuro-psychometric
 
and
 
NLP
 
analysis,
 
rigorous
 
bias
 
mitigation
 
via
 
the
 
Cortex
 
Calibration
 
Layer,
 
and
 
its
 
unique
 
self-governing,
 
phased
 
micro-chunking
 
methodology.
 
It
 
focuses
 
on
 
underlying
 
cognitive
 
and
 
technical
 
aptitude,
 
not
 
just
 
linguistic
 
fluency,
 
ensuring
 
fairness
 
and
 
accuracy.
  Q2:  How  does  TeamStation  AI  ensure  fairness  for  L2  ESL  candidates?  A2:  Fairness  is  paramount.  The  Cortex  Calibration  Layer,  combined  with  the  emphasis  on  Conceptual  
Fidelity
 
and
 
detailed
 
NLP
 
analysis
 
(considering
 
phonology,
 
morphology,
 
semantics,
 
discourse),
 
ensures
 
that
 
linguistic
 
variations,
 
accents,
 
and
 
communication
 
styles
 
influenced
 
by
 
L1
 
backgrounds
 
are
 
understood
 
and
 
calibrated,
 
not
 
penalized.
 
We
 
evaluate
 
the
 
substance
 
of
 
the
 
technical
 
argument
 
and
 
cognitive
 
process,
 
irrespective
 
of
 
linguistic
 
perfection.
  Q3:  What  specific  NLP  techniques  are  employed  by  Axiom  Cortex?  A3:  Axiom  Cortex  employs  a  broad  spectrum  of  NLP  techniques,  including  analysis  of  phonology,  
morphology,
 
syntax
 
(chunking,
 
parsing,
 
grammatical
 
formalisms),
 
semantic
 
processing,
 
lexical
 
semantics,
 
discourse
 
analysis,
 
and
 
the
 
detection
 
of
 
specific
 
linguistic
 
flags
 
related
 
to
 
cognitive
 
load
 
and
 
fluency.
 
These
 
are
 
integrated
 
via
 
advanced
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
directly
 
within
 
the
 
LLM.
  Q4:  How  does  the  "Self-Governing"  aspect  of  Axiom  Cortex  work?  A4:  The  system  operates  through  strict  phases  with  built-in  Integrity  &  Certainty  Assurance  Layer  (ICAL)  
self-validation
 
checkpoints.
 
If
 
an
 
analysis
 
step
 
fails
 
validation,
 
the
 
LLM
 
is
 
instructed
 
to
 
re-process
 
that
 
specific
 
chunk
 
or
 
halt,
 
ensuring
 
adherence
 
to
 
the
 
protocol
 
without
 
constant
 
external
 
oversight.
 
This
 
makes
 
the
 
process
 
robust
 
and
 
reliable.
 Q5:  What  is  "Conceptual  Fidelity"  in  this  context?   A5:  Conceptual  Fidelity  is  our  core  principle:  evaluating  whether  a  candidate  understands  the  concept  or  
principle
 
behind
 
a
 
technical
 
problem
 
or
 
solution,
 
even
 
if
 
they
 
express
 
it
 
using
 
different
 
words,
 
analogies,
 
or
 
phrasing
 
than
 
an
 
"ideal"
 
answer
 
might
 
use.
 
We
 
measure
 
the
 
alignment
 
of
 
their
 
thinking,
 
not
 
their
 
vocabulary.

APPENDIX  C  —  LIMITATIONS  AND  MISUSE  SCENARIOS  
C.1  KNOWN  LIMITATIONS  
 
The
 
evaluator
 
measures
 
reasoning
 
quality
 
and
 
job-relevant
 
behaviors
 
expressed
 
in
 
responses.
 
It
 
does
 
not:
 
(a)
 
verify
 
identity,
 
(b)
 
establish
 
authorship
 
of
 
prior
 
work,
 
(c)
 
substitute
 
for
 
background
 
or
 
reference
 
checks,
 
(d)
 
guarantee
 
performance
 
under
 
novel,
 
high-stress
 
contexts
 
outside
 
interview
 
conditions.
 
Scores
 
can
 
degrade
 
under
 
extreme
 
domain
 
shift
 
(unseen
 
stacks,
 
niche
 
protocols)
 
or
 
when
 
audio
 
quality
 
is
 
severely
 
compromised.
 
C.2  EXTERNAL  VALIDITY  BOUNDS  
 
Results
 
generalize
 
to
 
software
 
engineering
 
roles
 
with
 
interview
 
formats
 
matching
 
the
 
methods
 
described
 
in
 
this
 
report.
 
Transfer
 
to
 
radically
 
different
 
tasks
 
(e.g.,
 
sales
 
negotiations,
 
medical
 
diagnosis)
 
is
 
out
 
of
 
scope.
 
C.3  SENSITIVITY  TO  INPUT  QUALITY  
 
Low-fidelity
 
transcripts,
 
heavy
 
crosstalk,
 
or
 
poor
 
microphone
 
capture
 
can
 
reduce
 
clarity
 
estimates
 
and
 
inflate
 
cognitive-load
 
signals.
 
The
 
pipeline
 
mitigates
 
this
 
through
 
integrity
 
checks
 
and
 
calibration
 
but
 
cannot
 
fully
 
recover
 
missing
 
information.
 
C.4  POTENTIAL  MISINTERPRETATIONS  
 
Aggregated
 
scores
 
are
 
designed
 
for
 
ranking
 
and
 
decision
 
support.
 
They
 
are
 
not
 
a
 
psychological
 
diagnosis,
 
are
 
not
 
a
 
measure
 
of
 
innate
 
ability,
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
interpreted
 
as
 
immutable
 
traits.
 
C.5  NON-GOALS  
 
The
 
system
 
does
 
not
 
attempt
 
to
 
infer
 
protected
 
attributes,
 
personality
 
types,
 
or
 
health
 
status.
 
Any
 
such
 
inference
 
is
 
explicitly
 
excluded.
 
C.6  MISUSE  SCENARIOS  AND  CONTROLS  
 
Prompted
 
or
 
scripted
 
answers
 
intended
 
to
 
game
 
the
 
rubric;
 
impersonation
 
with
 
prerecorded
 
audio;
 
plagiarism
 
of
 
published
 
solutions;
 
adversarial
 
paraphrase
 
to
 
confuse
 
scoring;
 
synthetic
 
voices
 
to
 
spoof
 
spontaneity.
 
Controls
 
include
 
integrity
 
checks,
 
paraphrase/entailment
 
cross-validation,
 
spontaneity
 
markers,
 
duplicate
 
detection,
 
and
 
reviewer
 
escalation.
 
APPENDIX  D  —  THREAT  MODEL  AND  RED-TEAMING  
D.1  ADVERSARY  CLASSES  
 
Casual
 
candidates;
 
determined
 
candidates
 
with
 
tooling;
 
external
 
attackers
 
seeking
 
model
 
extraction;
 
insider
 
threats
 
with
 
privileged
 
access.
 
D.2  ATTACK  SURFACES

re-examination
 
with
 
fresh
 
eyes
 
and
 
a
 
recorded
 
rationale.
 
 
APPENDIX  I  —  VERSIONING  AND  CHANGE  LOG  
I.1  VERSIONING  POLICY  
 
Every
 
release
 
of
 
prompts,
 
rubrics,
 
models,
 
and
 
calibration
 
parameters
 
carries
 
a
 
unique

evidence.
 
Prior
 
versions
 
remain
 
accessible
 
for
 
audit
 
and
 
reproduction.
 
APPENDIX  J  —  BENCHMARKING  PROTOCOL  AND  REPORTING  STANDARD  
J.1  SCOPE  
 
This
 
appendix
 
defines
 
how
 
external
 
benchmarks
 
are
 
prepared,
 
executed,
 
and
 
reported
 
for
 
the
 
evaluator.
 
It
 
standardizes
 
dataset
 
handling,
 
compute
 
environments,
 
baselines,
 
metrics,
 
statistical
 
tests,
 
and
 
disclosure
 
so
 
results
 
are
 
reproducible
 
and
 
comparable
 
over
 
time.
 
J.2  TASK  SUITES  
 
Benchmarks
 
cover
 
three
 
families
 
of
 
tasks
 
relevant
 
to
 
engineering
 
evaluation:
 
 
•
 
Real-world
 
software
 
defect
 
and
 
patch
 
tasks
 
drawn
 
from
 
open-source
 
issue/PR
 
corpora
 
with
 
executable
 
tests.
 
 
•
 
Algorithmic
 
and
 
coding
 
tasks
 
requiring
 
stepwise
 
reasoning
 
and
 
implementation
 
under
 
unit
 
tests.
 
 
•
 
Conceptual
 
and
 
multi-step
 
technical
 
reasoning
 
tasks
 
drawn
 
from
 
public
 
academic-style
 
question
 
sets.
 
 
Each
 
task
 
suite
 
includes
 
a
 
license
 
review
 
and
 
citation
 
to
 
its
 
original
 
maintainers.

=== PAGE 23 ===

J.3  DATASET  PREPARATION  
 
•
 
De-duplicate
 
prompts
 
and
 
targets;
 
remove
 
near-duplicates
 
across
 
train/eval
 
splits.
 
 
•
 
Enforce
 
license
 
and
 
usage
 
terms;
 
exclude
 
items
 
with
 
ambiguous
 
or
 
proprietary
 
content.
 
 
•
 
Normalize
 
formatting
 
(whitespace,
 
encoding,
 
line
 
endings).
 
 
•
 
Leak
 
checks:
 
scan
 
prompts
 
and
 
references
 
for
 
overlap
 
with
 
any
 
internal
 
training
 
or
 
prompt
 
material;
 
exclude
 
any
 
item
 
with
 
suspected
 
leakage.
 
 
•
 
Language
 
notes:
 
when
 
tasks
 
are
 
language-agnostic,
 
treat
 
responses
 
in
 
any
 
language
 
as
 
valid
 
if
 
they
 
satisfy
 
tests;
 
document
 
any
 
language
 
constraints.
 
J.4  EVALUATION  ENVIRONMENT  
 
•
 
Frozen
 
configuration:
 
fixed
 
rubric/model
 
versions,
 
seeds,
 
and
 
calibration
 
parameters;
 
version
 
tags
 
recorded
 
in
 
the
 
run
 
log.
 
 
•
 
Deterministic
 
execution:
 
pinned
 
container
 
image,
 
compiler/interpreter
 
versions,
 
and
 
package
 
locks
 
for
 
code-execution
 
tasks.
 
 
•
 
Resource
 
limits:
 
uniform
 
CPU/RAM/time
 
caps;
 
no
 
network
 
access
 
during
 
execution
 
unless
 
explicitly
 
required
 
by
 
the
 
task
 
and
 
documented.
 
 
•
 
Logging:
 
store
 
per-item
 
inputs,
 
outputs,
 
stdout/stderr,
 
exit
 
codes,
 
and
 
test
 
results;
 
attach
 
hashes
 
for
 
integrity.
 
J.5  BASELINES  
 
Report,
 
at
 
minimum:
 
 
•
 
Heuristic
 
baseline
 
(simple
 
rules
 
or
 
majority/lexical
 
baseline).
 
 
•
 
Non-calibrated
 
evaluator
 
(no
 
language/culture
 
calibration).
 
 
•
 
Calibrated
 
evaluator
 
(final
 
production
 
stack).
 
 
All
 
baselines
 
run
 
under
 
the
 
same
 
environment
 
and
 
task
 
splits.
 
 
J.6  METRICS  
 
•
 
Pass@1
 
/
 
pass@k
 
for
 
code
 
tasks:
 
fraction
 
of
 
test
 
suites
 
passed
 
by
 
the
 
top-1
 
(or
 
top-k)
 
attempt.
 
 
•
 
Patch
 
success
 
for
 
defect
 
tasks:
 
fraction
 
of
 
issues
 
resolved
 
with
 
all
 
tests
 
passing.
 
 
•
 
Exact-match
 
and
 
semantic-match
 
for
 
short-form
 
answers:
 
token-level
 
exact
 
match
 
plus
 
entailment-based

•
 
Flag
 
uncertainty
 
rather
 
than
 
infer
 
missing
 
evidence;
 
escalate
 
when
 
needed.
