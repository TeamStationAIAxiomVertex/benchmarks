    "summary": "This preprint argues that resume-based engineering hiring is statistically unreliable in AI-augmented software environments and that latent cognitive traits are more predictive of retention and contribution than static skill indicators. Using TeamStation Cortex 3.0.0 across the LATAM-US nearshore corridor, the study reports materially better hiring quality and outcome prediction under calibrated neuro-psychometric evaluation.",
    "key_findings": [
      "Static skill indicators had near-zero predictive power for job performance, retention, and system contribution.",
      "Latent traits such as Architectural Instinct, Problem Solving Agility, Learning Orientation, and Collaborative Cognition explained most observed variance in six-month outcomes.",
      "False-positive hiring errors decreased from approximately 42% under human screening to 8% under Cortex evaluation.",
      "False-negative screening errors decreased from approximately 35% to 4%.",
      "Six-month retention prediction improved from R^2 about 0.15 (human evaluation) to R^2 about 0.72 (Cortex evaluation).",
      "Language calibration removed major second-language bias effects; translation latency was estimated to account for about 35% of rejected high-quality LATAM candidates."
    ],
    "methodology_relevance": "Provides a quantitative validation framework for benchmarking talent-evaluation systems in AI-augmented engineering pipelines, including outcome-linked metrics (false positive/negative rates, retention prediction), language-bias calibration, and psychometric signal extraction methods that can be mapped directly into benchmark validation criteria.",
